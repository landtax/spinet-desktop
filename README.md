Spinet is very good by itself but the experience is not 100% satisfactory. Some features are requested by users.

# Objectives (based on intense user requests)
* Be able to start processes leave and come back when are done.
* Some kind of notification when process is done.
* Clutter-free UI. Spinet covers almost all functionalities but users (novice) get lost in UI.
